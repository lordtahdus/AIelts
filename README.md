AIELTS, a fusion of “AI” and “IETLS”, stands as a Language Learning Model (LLM) specifically tailored to address the needs of IELTS learners in Vietnam. Our unique approach involves providing personalized feedback on essays, aligning with the marking criteria. AIELTS delivers feedback entirely in Vietnamese.

We envision a future where economic barriers do not impede access to quality English education. Our mission is to empower students who cannot afford expensive courses by offering them an affordable and efficient alternative.
