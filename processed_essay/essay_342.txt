Essay:

"There is an opinion for the future that in 30 years the most common form of education where the teacher makes a lesson in a classroom will cease to exist. I do not agree with such a statement and believe that a teacher would never be totally substituted by anything.

To begin with, I believe that by 2050 ways of teaching can change but it is difficult to predict how. I believe that even if the education would go fully online, the teacher would still be neededFor example, during the lockdown, a lot of people were forced to switch to distant studying, and then it turned out that this is quite convenient. There is also an opinion that in 30 years a lot of professions will be replaced by robots and machines. Some people even believe that a teacher will not be needed - all knowledge will be able to flow directly to a person&#39;s brain by using the latest technologies. I cannot agree with such a statement as I think that a teacher is necessary anyway ñ you cannot find out all the needed details of a certain subject yourself.

Moreover, I believe that it will not be possible to completely replace the teacher as it is much more pleasant to study having communication with a human, not a robot. We often need a mentor and his or her advice. In addition, there are special subjects that are best studied under the supervision of a teacher in the classroom. For example, it is better to conduct experiments in chemistry in the laboratory under the teacherís control so that he or she can correct students &#39; mistakes in time without consequences."

Here is your edited essay:

------------------

There is an opinion that the traditional teaching situation, where a teacher leads the lesson in a classroom, will become obsolete by the year 2050. However, I disagree with this viewpoint and contend that teachers will always be an indispensable aspect of education.

Firstly, while the methods of teaching may evolve by 2050, it is challenging to predict what these changes will entail. Even if education were to transition entirely to online platforms, teachers would still be crucial. For instance, during the recent lockdown, many individuals were compelled to engage in remote learning, and it became apparent that this approach can be quite convenient. However, it is noteworthy that despite the virtual nature of these lessons, the role of the teacher remained invaluable in guiding students through the curriculum. Therefore, to claim that a teacher will no longer be necessary is unfounded since comprehensive knowledge acquisition cannot be solely achieved through self-study.

Furthermore, it is unlikely that teachers will be entirely replaced as human interaction is essential to effective learning. We often require mentors and their guidance to flourish academically. Moreover, certain subjects are best studied under the direct supervision of a teacher in a physical classroom. For example, conducting experiments in a chemistry laboratory under the watchful eye of a teacher ensures that students' mistakes can be corrected promptly, averting any potential consequences that may arise. These hands-on experiences and immediate feedback play an imperative role in deepening the understanding of complex concepts. A robot or machine cannot fulfill this critical role effectively.

In conclusion, while the teaching methodologies may transform over time, I firmly believe that the role of a teacher will remain essential in education. Even if education becomes predominantly online, teachers will still be needed to provide guidance and ensure comprehensive learning. Furthermore, the human element of teaching, including mentorship and immediate feedback, cannot be replaced by machines. Therefore, I completely disagree with the notion that the typical teaching situation will cease to exist by 2050.
