"Some people think that products should be made to last as long as possible, while others think making the products cheap is more important.

Discuss both views and express your own opinion."

Essay:

"It is asserted that the durability of products is of great importance. However, cost-effectiveness is a key factor that appears to have a number of proponents. I advocate the former group.

On the one hand, some advocate the idea of more reasonably-priced products. To begin with, having a voracious appetite for shopping affordable goods, people encourage a consumer-driven manufacturing process by which production lines would be expanded. Under this circumstance, more job opportunities could be made and the wheels of industry will be kept turning. An obvious example of this is China, known for its mass production. Not only has it recruited many locals, but also an array of jobs have been developed around the world. Furthermore, supporters of affordable goods claim that class disparity could be less apparent. Simply put, all walks of life would be able to accommodate their needs even the proletariat whose desires have been suppressed.

However, the longevity of goods takes priority in other people’s opinion. The first compelling reason is that a culture of consumerism would no longer be promoted. In other words, when products last for a long time, people, irrespective of their purchasing power, try not to give in to the urge to go shopping. This is clearly delineated in a society where the trend-led approach to purchasing fashion clothing is rejected and replaced by slow fashion, focusing on conscious buying and thoughtful purchases. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between built-to-last items and their positive impacts on the environment. To put it another way, the more sustainable material is used, the less environmentally damaging waste, such as plastic, would be dumped, leading to securing the future of our planet.

To conclude, I would tend to side with those supporting longevity when it comes to purchasing. It seems to be unreasonable to put the environment in jeopardy by generating more waste and seems more logical to prevent the mass discarding of goods and consumerist culture."


Revised:

It is argued by some that the durability of products is paramount, while others believe that prioritizing affordability is more important. In my opinion, I agree with the former group.

On the one hand, proponents of affordable products argue that they stimulate consumer demand and contribute to economic growth. By making goods more affordable, people are encouraged to make purchases, thereby driving up production and creating more job opportunities. China, for example, is renowned for its mass production strategy, which has not only provided employment to its citizens but also created jobs globally. Additionally, advocates of affordable goods argue that it helps reduce class disparities as people from different income brackets can afford their desired products.

On the other hand, those who prioritize the longevity of products believe that it is essential to shift away from a culture of consumerism. When products are designed to last a long time, individuals, regardless of their purchasing power, are less inclined to constantly engage in shopping. This phenomenon can be seen in the rise of "slow fashion," where thoughtful and conscious buying replaces the trend-led approach to clothing purchases. Moreover, durable products have a positive impact on the environment as they reduce the amount of waste and promote the use of sustainable materials. This approach aligns with the goal of securing a sustainable future for our planet.

In conclusion, I believe that the longevity of products should be prioritized when making purchasing decisions. It is unreasonable to endanger the environment by generating excessive waste, and it is more logical to prevent the mass discarding of goods and the perpetuation of a consumerist culture. By embracing durability, we can ensure sustainable consumption patterns that benefit both individuals and the planet.
