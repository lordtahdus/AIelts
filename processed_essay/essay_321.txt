"Dear Jahid,

I hope this letter finds you best in health and spirits. I am writing you this letter to give you my suggestion for learning a suitable sport, basketball. It is a sport which can keep you very fit and healthy.

To learn to play basketball, every day after work come to Wellesley Court, which is 10 minutes far from both of our places. We can start over with some basic drills. Building stamina is essential for this sport therefore to build stamina we can take 10 laps of the whole court. Afterwards, we can do some dribbling drills around the whole court to make ourselves comfortable running with the ball. And finally, we can take some shots around the whole court. 

Once we are good with this first startup practice, we can start playing a 1 on 1 match to get easier with the basic rules. Practicing this sport with each other can be beneficial for both of us in terms of staying fit and learning a new sport.

I am sure you will absolutely like this sport. I am hoping to hear back from you soon. Hope we can start the new sport by next week. Please let me know your convenient time after work.

Best Regards,

Revised:

Dear Jahid,

I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to you today in response to your request for advice on learning a new sport. 

Considering your interest in physical fitness, I highly recommend that you learn basketball. It is not only a popular sport but also an excellent way to stay fit and healthy.

To begin learning basketball, I suggest that we meet at Wellesley Court, which is conveniently located just 10 minutes away from both of our homes. We can start with some basic drills to familiarize ourselves with the sport. It is crucial to build stamina in basketball, so we can start by completing 10 laps around the court. Afterward, we can focus on dribbling drills, which will help us become comfortable running with the ball. Finally, we can move on to taking shots from different positions on the court.

Once we have mastered the basics, we can progress to playing one-on-one matches to better understand the rules and improve our skills. By practicing this sport together, both of us can benefit from staying fit while learning something new.

I am confident that you will enjoy playing basketball as much as I do. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on my suggestion. If you are in agreement, we can start our new sporting venture next week. Please let me know your availability after work.

Best regards,
Nazmul

Coherence and Cohesion:

The coherence and cohesion of your essay is generally good. You have managed to connect your ideas and sentences together in a logical manner. However, there are a few areas where there could be some improvements:

1. Sentence structure: While your sentences are generally well-structured, there are a few instances where the sentence structure could be improved. For example, in the sentence "To learn to play basketball, every day after work come to Wellesley Court, which is 10 minutes far from both of our places", it would be clearer to say "To learn to play basketball, we can meet at Wellesley Court every day after work, which is 10 minutes away from both of our places." This revised sentence flows more smoothly and is easier to understand.

2. Transitions: While you do use transitions appropriately in your essay, there could be a few more used to improve the overall coherence. For example, in the paragraph where you explain the drills you can do, you could use a transition word or phrase at the beginning of each sentence to indicate the sequence of the drills. For instance, you could start the first sentence with "Firstly," and the second sentence with "Afterwards," to clearly show the progression of the drills.

3. Paragraph organization: Your essay is organized into paragraphs, which is good. However, there could be a clearer separation between paragraphs to improve the overall coherence. For example, you could use a new paragraph when you transition from talking about the drills to suggesting playing a 1 on 1 match. This would make it easier for the reader to follow the flow of your ideas.

Overall, the coherence and cohesion of your essay is quite good. With some slight improvements in sentence structure, transitions, and paragraph organization, your essay would be even more cohesive and easy to follow. Keep practicing and pay attention to these aspects in order to improve your overall writing score.
