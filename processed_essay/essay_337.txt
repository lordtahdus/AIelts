Introduction:
The given bar graph illustrates the global sales (in billions of dollars) of various digital games from 2000 to 2006. The data reveals distinct patterns and trends in the revenue generated from different gaming platforms during this period.

Body Paragraph 1:
In the year 2000, the sales figures for handheld games stood at approximately 11 billion dollars, which was notably higher compared to console games, with sales hovering around 6 million dollars. It is worth mentioning that there were no available figures for online and mobile phone games in that particular year. However, a significant shift occurred by the year 2004, with online and mobile phone games gaining popularity and generating sales of approximately 3 billion dollars.

Body Paragraph 2:
Over the subsequent seven-year period, a noticeable fluctuation can be observed in the sales of most digital games, except for handheld games which consistently increased. By 2006, the revenue from handheld games had surged to nearly 18 billion dollars, surpassing all other gaming platforms. In contrast, console games experienced a decline, earning the lowest income at about 2 billion dollars. Conversely, mobile phones and online games witnessed a remarkable increase, generating over 5 billion dollars in revenue by the end of 2006.
