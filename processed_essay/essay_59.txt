Topic:

"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: “It is better to be a follower than a leader.”"

Essay:

"In daily lives people have various positions in various parts of the world. A differentiation occurs between leaders and followers. Some people prefer to be a leader and free; nonetheless, others like to be a follower and depend on others. As far as I am concerned, I would rather be a leader instead of being a follower.

Initially, a leader is a director of a group and they are able to decide freely by considering both themselves and their group. They can decide or act independently when compared to followers and other members of the group. It is a fact that, sometimes, conversations and brainstorming can be necessary to find the optimum choice, however, a leader can make a decision by themselves in a risky situation without discussions. Or even a leader can follow their own path when conflicts arise because of clash of ideas since they have the power among the group. Therefore, a leader is the independent symbol of the group and they are able to play the dominator role of a group.

Secondly, a person can gain confidence by being a leader and they can use their increased confidence in diverse areas. Followers often involved in such discussions or conflicts, they are not sufficiently able to apply their own ideas. Nevertheless, by leading a society or crowd, leaders incessantly obtain self-confidence. They start to decide more legitimately and calmly when they encounter stressed and pressuring difficulties with the help of their confidence. Moreover, this confidence can assure accomplishment for leaders. In different parts of their lives, they may be successful and canalize others with a sense of self-confidence., which could bring success  Consequently, being a leader also helps people to be more confident and fulfill in different areas.

To sum up, being a leader has positive effects and consequences. First, it helps to be more free and independent. Second, it also ensures being confident and determined. Up to me, I would definitely prefer to be a leader."


Revised:

Here is an edited version of the essay:

In society, people hold various positions, and a differentiation exists between leaders and followers. While some people prefer to lead, others find comfort in following others. The statement "It is better to be a follower than a leader" is highly debated. From my point of view, I disagree as I would rather be a leader than a follower.

To begin with, a leader is someone who directs a group and has the freedom to make decisions that benefit both themselves and the group. Unlike followers, a leader can decide and act independently. In situations where there is a risk, a leader can make a decision without discussions or follow their own path when there are conflicts within the group because they have the power to make decisions. Therefore, a leader is a symbol of independence in a group and can play the dominant role.

Additionally, being a leader helps to build confidence which can be utilized in various areas of life. A follower is often not sufficiently equipped to apply their own ideas. However, by leading a group, individuals gain self-confidence which they can apply to more stressful situations. This confidence assures success for the leader and provides them with the necessary reassurance to make decisions with greater legitimacy. Furthermore, this confidence helps to inspire and motivate others. Consequently, being a leader also helps people to be more confident and successful in different areas of their lives.

In conclusion, being a leader has positive effects and consequences. First, it helps to be more free and independent. Second, it also fosters self-confidence and determination. Therefore, I believe that being a leader has many benefits and would choose to be one over a follower.
