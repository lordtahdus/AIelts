Discuss both views and give your opinion"

Essay:

"Nowadays, some of countries suggest that economic progress is their most profit aim. I strongly believe that other types of progress are equally important for a government.

Economic progress it is a one of the main ways to improve the living conditions in the contries. From economic progress depent a lot of factors. For example, the prices for goods and clothes. China has high level of economic, consequently they have two prices for products. 

On another hand, not all of the ways to improve your country depent from economic progress. Also, tourism progress is the best way to uplift the status of government. For example, Dubai. People think that Dubai became the one of the richest countries because of the oil and gas, but it is not true. According to the information, that I read in websites around 90% of oil is located in Abu Dhabi, that is why Dubai did not improved cause of the oil effect. Dubai tried to develop tourism progress. According to the newspapers, every year Dubai earning around 900 million dollars from tourism.

In conclusion, economic progress is important for countries, but do not outweight the other types of progress such as tourism and sport. It is necessary to develop other progresses, that will help to uplift the government’s status."

Introduction:
Many governments prioritize economic progress as the primary goal of their policies. However, some argue that other forms of progress are equally crucial for the development of a country. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my opinion on the matter.

Body Paragraph 1:
Economic progress is undoubtedly essential for improving the standard of living in a nation. It affects many aspects of society, such as employment, income, prices, and infrastructure. For instance, China has achieved a remarkable level of economic growth, which has led to price fluctuations and made products cheaper for some but more expensive for others, as highlighted in the trade war with the US. Therefore, governments must pay attention to the economic sector and implement policies that promote growth, innovation, and stability for the benefit of their citizens.

Body Paragraph 2:
However, economic progress is not the only factor that contributes to a country's success. Another area that can influence a nation's image, status, and revenue is tourism. By attracting visitors from all over the world, a country can showcase its beauty, culture, history, and hospitality. Dubai is a prime example of a country that has leveraged tourism to boost its economy. Despite having little oil reserves, it has transformed itself into a global hub for business, leisure, and entertainment, generating billions of dollars from tourism annually.

Body Paragraph 3:
In addition to tourism, there are other forms of progress that are essential for a government, such as education, healthcare, social welfare, human rights, and environmental protection. These areas may not have a direct impact on the economy, but they contribute to the well-being and happiness of citizens, which, in turn, can lead to greater productivity, innovation, and creativity. For example, Finland is known for its high-quality education system, which has helped it achieve a high standard of living, a low crime rate and social equality. Therefore, governments should not overlook these critical areas and should invest more in them to enhance the overall development of the country.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, economic progress is undoubtedly crucial, but it should not be the only focus of a government's policies. Other forms of progress, such as tourism, education, healthcare, social welfare, human rights, or environmental protection, are equally vital for achieving long-term sustainable development. As such, governments should find the right balance between economic growth and social progress and implement policies that promote both for the betterment of their citizens.
