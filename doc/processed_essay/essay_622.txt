"‘Everybody should donate a fixed amount of their income to support charity.’ How far do you share this viewpoint?"

Essay:

"It is said that a certain portion of the salary that people receive must be contributed to foundations. It seems to me that philanthropy should not be forced on everybody, and I will explain why in this essay. 

Firstly, everybody has different financial circumstances as well as priorities, which restricts their budget to their own needs and desires. This includes utilities that they should pay monthly, such as electricity, water supply, groceries, and insurance; and even if they have excess money left, some people will spend it for their leisure. A second negative factor is that individuals find it difficult to trust some charities because of scam histories. This happens when there are philanthropical facilities that take advantage of people and take away the donation fees for themselves, which created a notorious image for such institutions. This leads us to the final, and perhaps most significant drawback to philanthropic actions, which is the pressure they put on individuals to fund families who are in need. By ,this we mean that if individuals feel forced and responsible to provide part of their income, otherwise they will be labelled as soulless people. 

Admittedly, there are some positives to benefaction, most notably the number of adults and children who may experience stuff that they have never had before, such as books, toys, proper clothing, food, etc. Nevertheless, it seems that for many humans, these things are outweighed by issues which can cause stress and economic burden to them. 

To sum up, the problems of financial concerns, assurance, and feeling obliged combine together to make donating challenging and potentially difficult responsibility for many, especially when they have their priorities. This is not to say that all should not give their portion of income, but it is important to do it on their own accord."


Revised:

"It is proposed that individuals should donate a fixed amount of their income to support charities. In my opinion, while philanthropy is important, I do not agree with the idea of making it compulsory for everyone. This essay will outline the reasons for my viewpoint.

To begin with, each person's financial circumstances and priorities differ, which means that their budget is allocated to their own needs and desires. This may include monthly expenses such as utility bills, groceries, insurance, and other essential payments. Moreover, people may choose to spend their remaining income on leisure activities. Therefore, imposing a mandatory donation can be unfair and impractical for individuals who need to manage their finances wisely.

Another significant concern is the lack of trust in some charitable organizations due to past scam incidents. Unfortunately, there have been cases where philanthropic facilities have taken advantage of people's generosity and misused donation funds for personal gains. Consequently, many individuals may hesitate to donate their hard-earned money to charities, fearing that their contribution may not reach those in need.

Furthermore, there is a social pressure for individuals to provide financial support to families in need. This can create a sense of obligation and guilt among those who are unable or unwilling to donate. It is unjust to label individuals who choose not to donate as soulless, as it undermines the personal freedom to decide how to use one's income.

While there are certainly positive outcomes of charitable acts, such as providing essential resources to underprivileged individuals and children, the aforementioned concerns outweigh the benefits for many people. The potential financial burden, lack of trust, and social pressure associated with mandatory donations can lead to stress and discontentment.

In conclusion, while philanthropy is a noble endeavor, I believe that it should not be enforced on everyone. People have different financial circumstances and priorities, and imposing mandatory donations can be unjust and impractical. It is important for individuals to have the freedom to decide how to allocate their income towards causes they genuinely believe in."
