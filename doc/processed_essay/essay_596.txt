"Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?"

Essay:

"It is believed by a group of social members that sounds are a suitable way of connecting members of society of various cultures and ages with one another. I totally agree with this opinion due to the reasons which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. 

On one hand, humankind has been always attracted to  sounds and rhythms, even from the time he lived in a cave and the only available music was the sound of nature which was mainly produced by water and wind movements or animals. So this characteristic is rooted in our souls. No matter where a person was born or what culture he grew up in, there is a special kind of song which will absorb his attention. Recent research and investigations show that even wildlife creatures, such as birds or camels can understand music and sync their movements with it, and there is no doubt that humans are absolutely ahead of them in this area.

On the other hand, expressing feelings and opening up can bring people together and as we know a vital role of song is talking about feelings which are commonly hidden or forgotten to show. These days, there are many applications like the website which is called Genius that provide lyrics and the metaphors or symbols which are behind them. society usually leaves their own opinions or vote for other’s ideas and even in some cases, they have long discussions over albums or tracks that have been released recently or a long time ago. 

To sum up, music was popular among human beings from the very beginning of their lives and it is the food of their souls, and it also can be a bridge for transferring emotions facts that are not usually discussed without the existence of songs because people find it difficult to expose them. As discussed in the above paragraphs, I totally agree with the idea that song is a good way of bringing people of different ages and nations together."

Here is the edited version of your essay with improvements in structure according to the IELTS writing task 2 format:

"It is believed by some members of society that music is an effective means of connecting individuals from different cultures and age groups. I completely agree with this viewpoint and will elaborate on the reasons in the following paragraphs.

On one hand, throughout history, humans have been inherently attracted to sounds and rhythms. This fascination dates back to ancient times when people lived in caves and were exposed to the natural music produced by water and wind movements, as well as animal sounds. This innate connection to music transcends cultural boundaries and is deeply ingrained in our souls. Regardless of a person's place of birth or cultural background, there is always a particular genre or style of music that captures their attention. Recent research even suggests that certain wildlife creatures, like birds or camels, are capable of understanding music and synchronizing their movements with it. It is evident that humans are far more advanced in this aspect.

Furthermore, music serves as a powerful medium for expressing emotions and fostering social connections. The role of songs in articulating feelings that are often concealed or forgotten cannot be overstated. In contemporary times, there are numerous platforms, such as the website 'Genius', that provide access to song lyrics and the metaphors or symbols embedded within them. People actively engage with these platforms, expressing their opinions, voting for their favorite artists, and engaging in discussions about recently released or timeless albums and tracks.

In conclusion, music has been a fundamental part of human existence since its beginnings, serving as nourishment for the soul. It acts as a bridge that allows the transfer of emotions and truths that are often left unspoken. As discussed above, I firmly agree that music is an effective means to unite people of various ages and cultural backgrounds."
