Topic:

"In some countries, owning a home rather than renting one is very important for people. Why might this be the case? Do you think this a positive or negative situation?"

Essay:

"The importance of welfare is irrefutable throughout society. Dwellers would tend to have a personal accommodation rather than the rent which could bring some drawbacks such as physical efforts, restrictions to renovation, and financial loss. I completely agree with this attitude and in this essay, I will elaborate on the merits of this approach.

To begin with, the predominant reason for this tendency is that they have to implement the landlord’s stringent laws which restrict the freedom of folk, and they cannot renovate the house with their taste. For instance, my friend does not have permission to have pets such as a dog or cat. Furthermore, another reason for growing this willingness is moving to another place needs physical effort and is time-consuming. For example, they are tortured by packing and transferring their furniture to another house. Moreover, residents may have fewer opportunities to save financially. A good illustration of this is they have to allocate a part of their money to a landlord instead of saving it.

On the other hand, I strongly believe that home ownership has many positive consequences. This attitude causes a push to work harder to own a mansion. If there is more satisfaction to have an abode, they would have fewer intentions to make money and they get rid of those problems that arise from being tenants.

In conclusion, buying an own land is so beneficial, because it gives a sense of satisfaction, fulfilment, and comfortable. Also, this conspicuous trend would not bring any drawbacks in people’s lives."


Revised:

In some countries, the ownership of a home is considered more significant than renting one. There are several reasons for this preference, including restrictions and limitations imposed by landlords, the inconvenience and physical effort involved in moving, and the financial implications of renting. I agree with this perspective, and in the following essay, I will discuss the merits of owning a home compared to renting one.

One of the primary reasons why people prioritize home ownership is the freedom it provides. When individuals rent a property, they are often subject to rigid rules and regulations imposed by landlords. These restrictions may include limitations on pet ownership, restrictions on making renovations, or the need to seek permission for minor modifications. For example, a friend of mine is not allowed to have pets such as dogs or cats in her rented apartment, limiting her choices and freedoms. On the other hand, when someone owns their own home, they have the flexibility to make whatever changes they desire, allowing them to create a living environment that suits their personal tastes and preferences.

Additionally, the physical effort and time required to move from one rented property to another can be a significant inconvenience. The process of packing and transferring furniture and belongings can be exhausting and time-consuming. This can lead to frequent disruptions in one's life and routines, causing unnecessary stress. By contrast, homeowners enjoy the stability and permanency of residing in their own property and do not have to undergo the hassle of frequent relocations.

Furthermore, owning a home can lead to better financial stability and security. Renting a property involves regular monthly payments to a landlord, which can be a significant drain on one's finances. This money could be better allocated towards saving or investment opportunities. By owning a home, individuals can allocate their finances towards building equity and assets, which can lead to long-term financial security. This stability also provides a sense of comfort and peace of mind, as homeowners do not have to worry about fluctuations in rental prices or the possibility of eviction.

In conclusion, the preference for home ownership over renting is driven by several factors, including the freedom to customize one's living space, the avoidance of the inconvenience of moving, and the ability to build financial stability and security. Overall, owning a home offers a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment, and this trend does not have any significant drawbacks in people's lives.
