"If we want to solve global problems, countries must learn to collaborate more and compete less. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"

Essay:

"The problems governments face nowadays are often shared by other countries. Many regions of the world suffer from extreme weather, internet crime and large population movements. Is it better to deal with these problems through collaboration or competition? I believe that competition is more effective.

Firstly, collaboration can be a very slow process. Although communication technology has improved greatly, countries that choose to collaborate still must work together across great distances using different languages. Relationships between leaders may develop slowly or even deteriorate as they negotiate across linguistic and cultural divisions. Political leaders may therefore lose trust in each other.

The second reason for my view is that attempts to collaborate are often unsuccessful. Countries with different aims and values often find it hard to work together, and the need to compromise often means that solutions become less effective. International agreements on climate change, for example, tend to lack ambition. Any failure to agree may even damage relationships between states. But if countries act individually, they can act more quickly and other countries might then gain from their experience.

 Lastly, I think that people tend to work harder when they compete. In the same way that businesses innovate in response to competition, competing countries may look for innovative solutions as they try to win respect from the international community. In fact, as a result of competition, several quite different solutions may be developed, and the world may benefit from a greater range of options.

In conclusion, collaboration represents a less effective process for solving problems than competition. There will always be some need to collaborate, for example, when resolving conflict. But if we want to solve problems, it’s essential that we take advantage of friendly competition."

Essay:

The problems faced by governments today are shared by many countries around the world. Issues such as extreme weather, internet crime, and large population movements affect various regions globally. The question then arises as to whether it is more beneficial to address these problems through collaboration or competition. In my opinion, competition is a more effective approach.

To begin with, collaboration can often be a slow and cumbersome process. Despite advancements in communication technology, countries that choose to collaborate must still overcome challenges such as language barriers and geographical distances. Negotiations across different languages and cultures can lead to slow progress or even deterioration in relationships between leaders. Consequently, political leaders may lose trust in one another, hindering effective collaboration.

Furthermore, attempts to collaborate can often prove unsuccessful, particularly when countries hold divergent aims and values. The need to compromise and reach consensus frequently results in less ambitious solutions. For example, international agreements on climate change often lack the necessary drive and urgency to combat the issue effectively. Additionally, the failure to reach an agreement may strain relationships between states. On the contrary, when countries act individually, they can respond more swiftly and others can learn from their experiences.

Finally, competition tends to motivate individuals to work harder. Similarly, when countries compete, they are driven to seek innovative solutions to gain respect and recognition from the international community. In fact, competition can lead to the development of several distinct solutions, providing the world with a broader range of options. The resulting diversity can ultimately benefit everyone involved.

In conclusion, collaboration alone is not as effective as competition in solving global problems. While some level of collaboration is necessary, particularly in resolving conflicts, it is essential to capitalize on friendly competition in order to effectively address issues. By encouraging competition, we stimulate greater innovation and development of solutions, resulting in a more comprehensive and effective approach to solving global challenges.
